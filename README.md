## hey, im mimi!

i'm a junior developer and overall nerd looking to create (*and contribute to!*) cool and exciting things! ✨

currently my areas of interest are pretty much anything, but especially:
- linux 🐧
- raspberry pi and homelab kind of things 🖥️
- python 🐍
- small IoT kind of things (especially things that blink) 🌈
- design of user interfaces/experiences 🖱️
- cool hacks ⌨️
- game development and many more! 🎮

i'm very eager to learn more, and especially want to look more into things like rust, c# and java, nixos, low level programming, homelab and networking, docker, electronics and many more :)
